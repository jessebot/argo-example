# ArgoCD and Vault on K8s
Just a quick example of how to set up a test Kuberentes (k8s) environment with KIND, and then use ArgoCD for k8s config management and Hashicorp's Vault for secret storage :)

# Tech stack and Dependencies
## Package Managers
- [brew](https://brew.sh/) - Missing package manager for Mac (also supports Linux)
  - Also got some scripts for Debian distros
- [helm2](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) - installs k8s apps (mostly a bunch of k8s yamls) [can also be helm3, just *not* helm1]

## Container Orchestration
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) - for the containers
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) - [THE CLUSTER](media/peridot.png) we use to scale containers :3
  - [KIND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) - Tool to spin up mini k8s cluster locally

## Secrets Management
[Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) - Open source secret management from Hashicorp

## Continuous Delivery
[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Continuous Delivery for k8s, from within k8s
- [Argo CLI tool](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli_installation/) - this will let you use ArgoCD without the web interface
- [ArgoCD Vault Plugin](https://argocd-vault-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/) - ArgoCD with Vault
- [ArgoCD Vault Replacer](https://github.com/crumbhole/argocd-vault-replacer)
### Config Management (K8s)
[Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) - kubernetes native config managment to install argo with vault

# Installation of quick k8s cluster (KIND)
## brew (On MacOS/Linux)
Make sure you have the `Brewfile` from this repo and then run: 
```bash
brew bundle install deps/Brewfile
```

## apt (On Debian distros)
This goes through the whole process with apt
```bash
.deps/apt_dep_installation.sh
```

Then you can create a quick small cluster with the below command. It will create a cluster called kind, and it will have one node, but it will be fast, like no more than a few minutes. 

```bash
$ kind create cluster
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.21.1) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

Not sure what to do next? 😅  Check out https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/
```

*Note: make sure you have `kubectl` installed, and you can install that with `brew install kubectl` as well*

You'll want to follow kind advice and get some important info with, as well as verify the cluster is good to go:
``` bash
$ kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:64067
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:64067/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

$ kind get clusters
kind

$ kg namespaces
NAME                 STATUS   AGE
default              Active   27m
kube-node-lease      Active   27m
kube-public          Active   27m
kube-system          Active   27m
local-path-storage   Active   27m
```

Now that we've verified we have a local k8s cluster, let's get Argo and Vault up and running!

# ArgoCD
Before doing anything, you'll need some namespaces:
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl create namespace vault
```

## Argo CD with Vault (Kustomize Install)
```bash
# Create a Directory to Store the yamls
mkdir kustomize && cd kustomize

# Download all the graciously provided - can also use curl
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-vault-plugin/main/manifests/argocd-cm.yaml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-vault-plugin/main/manifests/argocd-repo-server-deploy.yaml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-vault-plugin/main/manifests/kustomization.yaml

# go up one dir
cd ..

# apply the kustomize files
kubectl apply -k kustomize
```

## Helm Installation without Vault
First we'll need helm (`brew install helm`, if you haven't already). Then, if you want this to be repeatable, you can clone this repo because you'll need to create the `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` in `charts/argo`. You can update your `version` parameter in `charts/argo/Chart.yaml` to the `version` param you see in [this repo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/master/charts/argo-cd/Chart.yaml), at whatever time in the future that you're working on this. If you don't verify that version you will end up like me, half way down this article... :facepalm:

Then you can run the following `helm` commands:

```bash
$ helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
"argo" has been added to your repositories

$ helm dep update charts/argo/
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "argo" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
Saving 1 charts
Downloading argo-cd from repo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
Deleting outdated charts
```

The next thing you need to do do is install the chart with:

```bash
$ helm install argo-cd charts/argo/
```

Now, for the perfect installation of our dreams:
```bash
$ helm install argo-cd charts/argo/
NAME: argo-cd
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed May 11 14:52:59 2022
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```
:chef-kiss:

## Argo via the GUI
You'll need to test out the front end, but before you can do that, you need to do some port forwarding so you can access it on localhost.
*If you installed ArgoCD **WITHOUT** Vault, use this command*:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argo-cd-argocd-server 8080:443
```

*If you installed ArgoCD **WITH** Vault, use this command*:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server 8080:443
```

Which should both give you this output:
```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
Handling connection for 8080
```

SUCCESS, we now get this in the browser:

<img src="media/argo_screenshot_2022-05-11_15.36.20.png" alt="Screenshot of the self-hosted-k8s ArgoCD login page in firefox" width="500"/>

You can now login with the default username, `admin`, and auto-generated password from this k8s secret:
```bash
kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```

In case of failure, check out the [Possible Errors](#Possible Errors) section for current known fixes.

### CLI
First you should generate cli completion for your shell of choice. In my case, it was BASH:
```bash
$ argocd completion bash > ~/.bashrc_argocd
$ source ~/.bashrc_argocd

# need to port forward, but we want this in the background
$ kubectl port-forward svc/argo-cd-argocd-server 8080:443 &
```

You'll need to make sure you have your argo CD server address set with:
```bash
# create the default config location:
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/argocd/config

# missing argo config set up ???

# then you can run the following
$ argocd login localhost:8080 --username admin --password $yourpassword
```
#### WARNING: the above command will fail right now

If you don't have the argoCD server address already specified you'll get this:
```bash
FATA[0000] Argo CD server address unspecified
```

# Vault
Follow along [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-raft-deployment-guide?in=vault/kubernetes).

```bash
# add the helm repo
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com

# create a spot for the chart
mkdir charts/vault && cd charts/vault/

# can also curl chart here
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/vault-helm/main/Chart.yaml
```

Then you'll want to review the current [values.yaml](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm/blob/main/values.yaml) for vault at the source. After that, or even before, you can pull the whole file and only use what you need:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/vault-helm/main/values.yaml
```

## Success!

# Possible Errors

### How to fix crd-install issue
*Why and How*
You would see this:
```bash
$ helm install argo-cd charts/argo/
manifest_sorter.go:192: info: skipping unknown hook: "crd-install"
manifest_sorter.go:192: info: skipping unknown hook: "crd-install"
NAME: argo-cd
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed May 11 10:53:55 2022
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

You need those CRDs, or the pod will just crash loop, and then when you try to follow the next logical step of port-forwarding to test the frontend, you'll get something like this, when you actually test it:
```bash
$ kubectl port-forward svc/argo-cd-argocd-server 8080:443
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
Handling connection for 8080
```

Which seems fine, but when you go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser you'll see this in stdout in your terminal:
```
E0511 11:07:43.094956   46063 portforward.go:406] an error occurred forwarding 8080 -> 8080: error forwarding port 8080 to pod 53c2b12a3c748bb2c9acd763ed898c5261227ca4b359c047ec264608cbc67058, uid : failed to execute portforward in network namespace "/var/run/netns/cni-84865981-c6a2-6e6d-1ce1-336602591e41": failed to connect to localhost:8080 inside namespace "53c2b12a3c748bb2c9acd763ed898c5261227ca4b359c047ec264608cbc67058", IPv4: dial tcp4 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused IPv6 dial tcp6 [::1]:8080: connect: connection refused

E0511 11:07:43.096354   46063 portforward.go:346] error creating error stream for port 8080 -> 8080: EOF
```

This happens because you're using an older version of argoCD, and is apparently because of [this issue](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/7972) and is fixed by [this](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6930), so you can just update your version.

*Fix*
Update `version` of your `charts/argo/Chart.yaml` to at least 4.6.0 (cause that's what worked for me :D)

Then you'll need to rerun the dep update:
```bash
helm dep update charts/argo/
```

Followed by uninstalling, and then reinstalling:
```bash
$ helm uninstall argo-cd
release "argo-cd" uninstalled
```
